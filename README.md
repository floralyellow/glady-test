# glady-test

## Initialise 
- Get java v20
- Get maven
- Get H2
- Create database with setting in application properties
- maven install

## Launch
- You can launch the project but I didn't know how to make fixtures and didn't make route to create company or user so you can test it via the tests in TransactionServiceTest.java
